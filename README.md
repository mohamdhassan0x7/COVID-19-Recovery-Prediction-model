COVID-19 Recovery Prediction Project
Overview:
This project aims to predict the recovery outcome (death/recovered) of individuals admitted to the hospital based on pre-defined standard symptoms recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The dataset, sourced from daily reports on the 2019 novel coronavirus, includes key variables such as country, age, gender, travel history to Wuhan, symptoms, and time before symptoms appear.

Dataset:
The "data.csv" file contains time series data starting from January 22, 2020, with cumulative information on affected cases, deaths, and recoveries. The dataset is already cleaned and preprocessed.

Classifiers Implemented:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Na√Øve Bayes (upcoming - due end of week 11)
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (upcoming - due end of week 14)
Process:
The data is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets.
Each classifier is designed and optimized with optimal hyperparameters.
Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC curves are utilized for comparison.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Access the dataset in "data.csv."
Run each classifier script independently.
Explore the results and performance metrics.
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Let's collectively enhance our understanding of COVID-19 recovery prediction!
