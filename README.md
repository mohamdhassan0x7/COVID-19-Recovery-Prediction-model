# COVID-19 Recovery Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts COVID-19 recovery outcomes using various classifiers (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) on preprocessed data. The dataset includes WHO-standard symptoms, age, gender, and travel history.

## Dataset
The dataset ("data.csv") covers daily reports from January 22, 2020, with cumulative information on affected cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Classifiers Implemented
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**

## Process
- Data is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Each classifier is designed and optimized with hyperparameters.
- Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC/AUC curves) are used for comparison.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Access the dataset in "data.csv."
3. Run each classifier script independently.
4. Explore results and performance metrics.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Let's collectively enhance our understanding of COVID-19 recovery prediction!
